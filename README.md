<h2>Background on <b>TheBrainCord</b> founder üòÑ </h2>
[<b>Caution:</b> <imp>Read if you are intersted! Its just a story of mine how I thought to create and want to make this BIG in future</imp>]
<p>I socially introduce myself as <b>RANaik</b>. I am a middle-class guy brought up from Indian village which is part of Karnataka costal(seashore of Arabian Sea). Grown with my parents, family and relatives happily and by default(without extra efforts) I was very good in understanding/solving Maths problems and high interest on Science to experiment evrything I learn or read! Studied in government schools and college in a local language medium. I decided to start earn quickly in a software field after completing my 2nd PU(+2) without knowing anything on Computer knowledge. Myself searched one internet in one of the cyber cafe and found the training center to pursue my DIPLOMA in computer engineering at Bangalore city. That's the great decession which I took in my early stage of the career and I have achieved my plans accordingly by changing decessions here and there where it required.</p>

<p><b>C/C++</b> programming languages were attracted me deeply when I get to know how they compiles and give output. This happens because of the method of teaching/training by one of great teacher. Our hobbies became changed in my college days to create our own creative problems and find solutions programmatically with best of best logics applying on them. It helped to build strong programming skills. Once I started using Linux OS, I liked to using that with in a terminal mode than GUI. Started showing interests on <b>Cyber Security/Hacking</b> technologies. I started learn them myself start expermenting them in few times when these knowledge requires. [<b>I don't consider these are my achievements even though I have succesfully acheieved in really quick time by self learning. (Note: Hacking activities which causes other's property is always illegal. I am just sharing my fun memories in technically):</b><ul> <li>Cracked college wifi password within 2 days succesfully to use fast internet. Also it was our batch students challenge to our seniors and I represented our batch as only I have installed required setups by researching from multiple streams/blogs/experiments üòÑ.</li><li>In a final year as I got job in a campus selection with my first Interview(Still I am working in a same organization as I change the team atleast every 1/2 years once), I started skipping the unnecessary non-technical 3rd party paid courses. But management made took strict actions on completing them necessarry and informed our batch students only one day before. When most of my friends started completing them. But I just invested my time on researching on `How can I hack them and update the data. I just beleive that "nothing is impossible", also in Software was developed by human and human always leave some gap in any softwares by not thinking on those cases. Somehow I found within 3 hours continuesly trying the somany different tries, found a way to update the data. I helped to my whole classmates to update marks and attendance to 95-99%. Even though college management knows that somehow we have hacked those data, but they are not able to prove them as only they had the Admin access to that web aplication.)</li></ul> This is how I enjoying the technology and upgraded the skills in every areas which were new to me and compared with the latest technologies. Later I started working as a proffesional in one of the top organization in the Electronics Industry! As a learner started exploring the Electronics Industries and latest automotive industries technologies. Parellally completed my Master's degree with good marks in top University by attending weekend classes. In my Post-Graduation I have submitted the research paper for my Electronics robotics related project and <b>research paper was selected with 0 Palgrism check by IEEE and quality contents with the technical details</b> which are researching on improving the speed of execution of "A star algorithm" and "Image processing" on low level H/W Due to few of my collegues were investing and mining the Bitcoins in 2017, I started showing my interests and still learning them and exploring.</p> 
<p>I achieved multiple technical stuffs wherever I got the chances to explore!</p>

<p>I always look into exploring new things in every areas, I started going solo trips to different places.<br> I started this by socializing myself more with the every kind of new people whom I meet and understand that most of the <q>Non-Technical</q> skills can be improve and people who has the great skills can get their expected credits/rewards to their strong set of skills. Only due to lack of <b>software knowledge</b> or <b>latest technologies</b> they are not able to showcase/grow in the fields where they have strong skills. People who catch these people with Software Knowledges are utilizing their strong skills and paying the credits to them which are not the proper reward for their skill sets.</p> 

<p> So I started <b>TheBrainCord MultiSolutions</b> which can help people who has strong skillsets in different areas can start show case their level and by working with TheBrainCord they can find a <b>better earning opportunities</b> as world is updating digitally very fast and only way to reach or showcase their skill sets to required Customers who can pay according to their level of skills.</p>
<p>I found that I can be part of helping people who are good at their skill sets and provide the outputs with the best quality in a quick time. <b>This can also be my personal goal to make TheBrainCord to big organization by providing multiple digital solutions to small buisiness. As of now meet few less financial ability people and created the great earning opportunities them in different ways from investing my own.</b> (Most financial concessions we provided till now only well-known people personally and analyzing their financial situations at present.)<br> Now concentrating on more customers + additional small buisiness ideas which can be added to TheBrainCord can help us to earn more returns and I can utilize them to updgrade skills and improve here</b></p>
